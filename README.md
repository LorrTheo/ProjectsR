# ProjectsR
These are a few of my personal projects with R

I am still new with R and RStudio, but am enjoying it quite a bit!  As I learn more, I will be cleaning up the currently posted projects as well as uploading others.  Credits to the University of North Carolina - Wilmington and the Cameron School of Business for their excellent program of Masters of Science in Business Analytics.
